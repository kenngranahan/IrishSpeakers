# IrishSpeakers
An analysis of the distribution of Irish Speakers using data collected from the national census

This data contains statistics on the number of Irish speakers and Non-Irish speakers gathered by the central statistics office(CSO), a government agency responsible for gathering statistics on the Irish population, primarily through the national census.
Their database can be found here:
https://www.cso.ie/en/databases/

Most of the data is only available as of 2011 since the national census only began a detailed survey on Irish speaking ability as of 2011.
The only exception is number of Irish speakers broken down by Province, which contains data dating back to 1861.
